# Features:
This browser's features include the ability to navigate to AI and non-AI shortcuts like ChatGPT, Bard, Youtube Music and Spotify. The Application is mainly privacy based. (Not encryption wise) The app however, can hide features from other users on your computer by a simple click of the lock icon. True encryption for this is coming soon. As well as encryption for hard coded passwords. Plus ease of installation.
